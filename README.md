# Develop-Production-Ready-Tool-Measurement-Software
seeking an experienced computer vision developer to create a complete software solution for identifying tools (cutting and forming tools) from images and accurately measuring their dimensions (length, width, and potentially height). The software will be used directly in our production environment and must be user-friendly, reliable, and efficient.
At the moment we don't have the hardware, so we are expecting as well guidance from you, to instruct us on how we build the hardware system. And you will be then in charge of the whole software.


- Measure the tools' dimensions (length and width) with high precision.
- Tools are always different. But we can separate them in some of the groups: drills, mills, cutting inserts, hobs, forming tools, punches. Then inside one category what will be measured will always be different.
- Dimensions of one tool to be measured up to: 100 x 200 x 100 (x,y,z) mm.
- Precision of measurement should be: 0,1 - 0,3 mm.
- Start of measurement could be manually confirmed over the app which would be a trigger for app to take a photo on the cameras and then process the images.
- 50-100 images per hour to be processed.
- Optional: Measure the height of tools (may require a second camera or an alternative method for depth measurements). - please advise

Output:
Export results into an Excel spreadsheet, listing tools with their measured dimensions (length, width, and height).

Camera Setup and Flexibility:
Allow for easy repositioning of the camera to capture tools from different sections of the workspace (e.g., along a fixed-height line).
Enable smooth transition for new inspection/measurement sessions in other areas of the production floor.

User-Friendly Software:
Develop a complete software solution that can be easily operated by production staff.
Include an intuitive user interface for loading images, viewing results, and exporting data.
Ensure that the software is robust and reliable for continuous use in a production environment.

Budget:
Open to proposals; include your estimated cost in the application.

End Goal:
With your recommendations in our company we build a hardware.
The final product must be a production-ready software solution that our team can use with minimal setup and training. The software should integrate seamlessly into our workflow, supporting reliable and efficient tool inspection and measurement.

======================
To create a comprehensive software solution for identifying and measuring tools in a production environment, we will approach the solution in multiple steps, focusing on both the hardware setup and the software development. Below is a detailed breakdown of the entire solution, including the guidance on hardware components and the Python code for image processing and measurement.
1. Hardware Recommendations:

    Camera: Since you're considering the DMK33GX264 camera, which is an industrial-grade camera, it should provide sufficient resolution (5 MP) for tool image capture. You can use it with a macro lens to get detailed close-up images of the tools.
    Lighting: Proper lighting is crucial for accurate measurements. Use diffused LED lights or ring lights to ensure even and shadow-free illumination.
    Calibration: For accurate measurements, use a calibration grid or reference objects. This ensures that measurements can be scaled correctly from pixels to real-world dimensions.
    Depth Measurement: To measure height, consider using a stereo camera setup or a structured light scanner like LiDAR for depth measurement.

2. Software Design and Requirements:

The software will need to:

    Capture Tool Images using the camera.
    Process Images to detect and classify tools.
    Measure Tool Dimensions (length, width, height).
    Export Results into an Excel spreadsheet.

The core components of the software are:

    Image Capture
    Image Processing and Measurement
    User Interface for Interaction
    Data Export to Excel

3. Software Development:

We'll use Python for image processing, tool detection, and measurement. OpenCV will be used for image processing, and NumPy will handle the calculations. We will also use Pandas to export results to Excel.
Key Libraries:

pip install opencv-python numpy pandas openpyxl

Python Code for Tool Measurement and Detection:

import cv2
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from openpyxl import Workbook

# Function for Tool Detection and Preprocessing
def detect_tool(image):
    # Convert image to grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Apply GaussianBlur to reduce noise
    blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0)
    
    # Use Canny Edge Detection to find contours
    edges = cv2.Canny(blurred, threshold1=30, threshold2=100)
    
    # Find contours
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(edges, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    
    return contours

# Function to Measure Tool's Dimensions (length, width, and height)
def measure_dimensions(contours, scale_factor=1.0):
    tool_length = 0
    tool_width = 0
    tool_height = 0

    if contours:
        # Approximate the contour to a polygon
        contour = max(contours, key=cv2.contourArea)
        rect = cv2.minAreaRect(contour)
        box = cv2.boxPoints(rect)
        box = np.int0(box)
        
        # Calculate length and width from bounding box
        tool_length = np.linalg.norm(box[0] - box[1]) * scale_factor  # Length of the tool
        tool_width = np.linalg.norm(box[1] - box[2]) * scale_factor   # Width of the tool
        
        # Optionally calculate height using additional methods (e.g., stereo or structured light)
        # For simplicity, assuming a flat tool in a 2D image (height can be inferred later).
        
    return tool_length, tool_width, tool_height

# Function to Save Measurements to Excel
def save_to_excel(measurements, filename="tool_measurements.xlsx"):
    df = pd.DataFrame(measurements, columns=["Tool", "Length (mm)", "Width (mm)", "Height (mm)"])
    df.to_excel(filename, index=False)
    print(f"Results saved to {filename}")

# Function to Capture Image (Simulated for this example)
def capture_image():
    # Replace with actual camera capture logic
    image_path = 'tool_image.jpg'  # Provide the path to the tool image file
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    return image

# Main Workflow
def main():
    # Capture image (simulate this for now, replace with real camera capture)
    image = capture_image()
    
    # Detect tool in the image
    contours = detect_tool(image)
    
    # Example tool classification (you can train an AI model for this)
    tool_type = 'Drill'  # For example, this can be detected automatically using an AI model
    
    # Measure tool dimensions
    tool_length, tool_width, tool_height = measure_dimensions(contours)
    
    # Collect measurements
    measurements = [
        {"Tool": tool_type, "Length (mm)": tool_length, "Width (mm)": tool_width, "Height (mm)": tool_height}
    ]
    
    # Save results to Excel
    save_to_excel(measurements)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

4. Explanation of the Code:

    detect_tool(): This function processes the image, converts it to grayscale, applies Gaussian blur to reduce noise, and uses Canny edge detection to find contours (the outline of the tool).
    measure_dimensions(): This function calculates the dimensions of the tool by fitting a minimum bounding rectangle to the contours. It computes the length and width based on the corners of the rectangle. If height measurement is required, additional methods like stereo vision or depth cameras need to be implemented.
    save_to_excel(): After processing and measuring, this function saves the results into an Excel file using Pandas and OpenPyXL.
    capture_image(): This function simulates image capture. In a real-world scenario, this will interface with the camera SDK to capture an image of the tool.

5. Optional Enhancements:

    AI-Based Tool Classification: To improve the identification of the tool type (e.g., drill, mill, cutting insert), you can train a deep learning model (e.g., CNN) using a dataset of labeled tool images. Libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch can be used for model training and integration.
    Depth Measurement for Height: To measure the height of tools, you can use:
        A stereo camera setup: Two cameras capture the same image from different angles, and depth is calculated based on disparity.
        Structured Light: Use a depth camera like Intel RealSense or LiDAR for measuring the 3D shape of the tool.

6. User Interface (UI):

For ease of use in the production environment, the application should have a user-friendly interface. You can implement this using a GUI framework like Tkinter or PyQt5 in Python. The UI should:

    Allow users to upload images.
    Display tool classification and measurements.
    Provide an export button to save the results to Excel.
    Offer a simple setup for the camera, calibration, and tool measurement process.

7. Hardware System Setup:

    Camera: Use the DMK33GX264 camera, which will capture the tool images.
    Lens: Use a macro lens to capture detailed images.
    Lighting: Ensure even, diffuse lighting to avoid shadows.
    Calibration: Use a reference object for accurate scaling.
    Measurement Setup: The system should be placed on a fixed platform or robotic arm for tool inspection.
    Software Interface: Integrate the Python software with a local machine or cloud-based server for processing.

Conclusion:

This solution includes the necessary Python code for image processing, tool detection, and measurement, along with guidance on hardware setup. The software is designed to be flexible and scalable, with the ability to measure tool dimensions precisely in a production environment. Future enhancements can include depth measurement, AI-based classification, and a user-friendly interface for seamless integration into your workflow.
